We will now conduct an experiment on your ability to memorize relational structures in text. You will be given a vignette which is a paragraph describing a network among mutiple entities. You will need to construct the network based on the description and memorize its structure as accurately as possible. You will be asked questions about this paragraph later in the experiment. Your success in correctly answering these questions will determine the amount of credit you earn at the end of the experiment.  Do you have any questions about this experiment?
