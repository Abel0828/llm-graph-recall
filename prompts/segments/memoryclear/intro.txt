Before we proceed to the recall part, we will perform an exercise with you. You will be given a series of sentences, grouped in sets of three sentences. At the end of each set, you will need to recall the last word in each preceding set. Over time, you will be asked to remember words from larger sets of sentences.  If you have any questions, please ask now. Otherwise, please inform us that you are ready to begin.
