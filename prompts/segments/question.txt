Now please recall the structure of the network you saw at the beginning, to the best of your ability. For every pair of nodes in the network, answer "1" or "0" to indicate whether they are associated in some way with each other. For example, they can be dating, friends, members of the same club, or having interactions in some scientific processes. Right now we are only interested in whether they have some kind of relationship to each other. As an example to format your output, if the network has three nodes, a, b, c, and only a and b know each other as friends, then output: (a,b): 1, (a,c): 0, (b,c): 0.  

Now output 1 or 0 for the following edges in the network:
